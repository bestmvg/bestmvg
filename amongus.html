			<p>At the beginning of each round you find out if you are an imposter or crewmate, but mostly its crewmate. </p>
			<p>As a crewmate your job is to do all of your tasks quickly and try to find out who the imposter is. If all of the crewmate complete their tasks before the imposter kills everyone they win. Or if they vote the imposter out they win aswell.</p>

		<h1>Imposter</h1>
			<img src="images/sus.png" alt="among us pic">
			<p>It is a small chance you can get imposter because there are usually only one or two out of ten players.</p>
			<p>Your job as an imposter is to kill all the crewmate before they complete their tasks. You cannot let anyone see you kill or they will be able to vote you out. Faking your tasks can help take suspision off of you.</p>
