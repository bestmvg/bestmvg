		<h3>Building and Upgrading Your Village</h3>

			<p>When you build your village you will have your town hall, defensive buildings like cannons and walls, resource buildings like gold mines and stoarges, or army buildings like barracks and army camp. You want to organize your village so you defend your elixir, gold, and town hall. It is easy to find a good base online to copy.</p>
			<p>Once you have your base layout, upgrade all your buildings. After you have all the buildings maxed out, upgrade your town hall. That will give you more buildings and allow you to upgrade them more.</p>

		<h1>Attacking other Villages</h1>
			<p>With your barracks you can train troops and house them in your army camp. Uprading these resources can give you better and more troops to attack with.</p>
			<p>When you attack you want to destroy the defenive buildings while getting all the loot. If you don't need the loot you can just attack for trophies. There are a lot of strategies you can do to win almost every attack.</p>
